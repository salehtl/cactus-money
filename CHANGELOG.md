All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [2.2.3] - 2026-03-10

### Fixed
- Recurring import failing with foreign key constraint errors
- PWA update banner dismiss now allows future update checks to resume
- Stale update cooldown no longer persists across component remounts
- Changelog hook no longer triggers redundant full-table DB scans on every settings change

## [2.2.2] - 2026-03-10

### Fixed
- Recurring transactions duplicating in cashflow: race condition in event emission and non-atomic insert

### Added
- Export Recurring button in settings (JSON export of recurring transactions)

## [2.2.1] - 2026-03-10

### Fixed
- PWA updater robustness: error handling, double-click guard, safe area spacing
- JSON import now round-trips anchor_day and is_variable for recurring transactions
- Snowball backup growth: pre-migration backup no longer nests previous backups
- `normalizeImportData` wired into JSON import (was dead code)
- `editStatus` type now includes "review" status for inline edit mode

### Changed
- Extract shared constants (BACKUP_TABLES, ANCHOR_DAY_FREQUENCIES) to reduce duplication
- Hoist StatusPill config to module-level constant, simplify variant logic
- Simplify reviewCount with loop instead of spread+flatMap+filter
- Clean up recurring scheduler in DbContext (flatten nested conditions, early returns)
- Simplify useCashflow auto-confirm and populateFutureMonth logic
- Inline trivial wrappers in recurring form and hooks
- Deduplicate field reset logic in cashflow inline-add row
- Updated PWA icons, OG image, and added twitter card

### Removed
- Dead `StatusPill.tsx` from cashflow/ (already extracted to ui/)
- Non-functional Review scroll button and unused firstReviewRef

## [2.2.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- Variable-amount recurring transactions with "review" status and cashflow banner notification
- Recurring page redesigned with separate Income/Expense groups and summary bar
- Anchor-day support for monthly/quarterly/yearly recurring (always lands on same day-of-month)
- Auto-generation of recurring transactions on app startup (catches up missed months)
- Pre-migration auto-backup stored in settings before schema upgrades
- Export/import compatibility for v2 backups (auto-derives anchor_day)

### Fixed
- Date drift bug: monthly recurring losing one day per iteration in UTC+ timezones
- Past recurring transactions now auto-set to "confirmed" instead of always "planned"
- Inline category creation from income recurring rules now correctly marks category as income

### Changed
- Schema version 3 → 4 (added anchor_day, is_variable columns to recurring_transactions)
- Export format version 2 → 3
- StatusPill extracted to shared component with three variants (planned/confirmed/review)
- Recurring scheduler unified into single processRecurringRules function (replaces processDue + autoPopulateFutureTransactions)

### Removed
- Dead `processDue()` code from useRecurring hook

## [2.1.2] - 2026-03-10

### Fixed
- PDF import showing "No Transactions Found" after streaming 100+ transactions — streamed transactions are now recovered when a batch fails mid-stream
- Future dates from LLM-parsed bank statements are now discarded (cleared to empty for user correction)

### Changed
- LLM response buffer limit raised from 1MB to 4MB to accommodate verbose models like GPT-4.1 Mini

## [2.1.1] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- Uncategorized filter toggle in PDF import review modal
- Portal-rendered category dropdown in review table (escapes overflow clipping)
- Model name shown in modal title during PDF import
- PWA update prompt — shows refresh banner when a new version is available
- Periodic SW update checks (every 15min) and on app foreground (with 5min cooldown)
- "Check for Updates" button in Settings
- Rate-limit docs link in RateLimitedView modal
- Rate-limit notices in file queue and streaming progress views
- Semver changelog policy in CLAUDE.md

### Changed
- Adaptive rate-limit backoff: exponential backoff with jitter (2s→4s→8s→16s, capped 30s) replaces fixed 2s delay
- Up to 4 attempts per batch before surfacing rate-limit error (was 2)
- 1s inter-batch delay smooths token consumption to avoid API bursts
- Privacy notice now provider-agnostic (was hardcoded to Anthropic)

### Fixed
- Partial rate-limit failure silently skipping batches in PDF import
- Streaming UX restored: transactions appear one-by-one during import instead of in bulk
- Select-all checkbox now scopes to active filter (file or uncategorized)
- Portal dropdown positioning: clamps to viewport edges and flips upward near bottom

## [2.1.0] - 2026-03-09

### Added
- Changelog with "What's New" viewer in Settings
- Multi-provider PDF import (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, custom)

### Added
- Zakat calculator with madhab-aware engine and stock support
- Two-column zakat layout with live breakdown and mobile sticky bar
